# 🎨 Spline Demo with React

This is a simple demo web app built with **React** and **[Spline](https://spline.design/)** to showcase how 3D assets created in Spline can be integrated into modern web applications.

🚪 This project was originally created for a **Tech Talk at Infobip**, where I demonstrated how developers and designers can leverage Spline to add interactive 3D scenes into React-based frontends with minimal setup.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌐 Built using **React + Vite**
- 🧱 Integrates a **Spline scene** directly into the React app
- 🎛️ Simple, responsive layout with interactive 3D content
- ⚡ Deployed to **Firebase Hosting**

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Clone the repo:

```bash

cd spline-demo
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🧹 How Spline Was Integrated

- A 3D scene was created using [Spline](https://app.spline.design/)
- The exported `.spline` scene or iframe embed was added to a React component
- Responsive styling was applied to make the experience smooth across screen sizes

You can replace the current Spline scene with your own by embedding a new public scene link or using the Spline runtime.
